# iOS Calculator App

This is one of my first iOS applicationsâ€”a simple calculator that replicates the default iPhone calculator. The app was built using Swift and UIKit, following best practices for UI design and layout adaptability.

## Features
- **Storyboard-based UI**: The entire interface was designed using Storyboard.
- **Adaptive Layout**: Implemented StackView and Auto Layout constraints to ensure proper UI adaptation across different iPhone models.
- **Calculator Logic**: Developed the logic to handle basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and percentage calculations.
- **Custom UIButton Extension**: Created a custom extension for `UIButton` to modify the design of specific buttons, enhancing the app's appearance.

## Technologies Used
- Swift
- UIKit
- Storyboard & Auto Layout
